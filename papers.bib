  abstract      = {
     The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set is itself well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by Higman is a cornerstone of the theory of well-quasi-orderings and has found numerous applications in computer science. However, this result is based on a specific choice of ordering on words, the (scattered) subword ordering. In this paper, we describe to what extent other natural orderings (prefix, suffix, and infix) on words can be used to derive Higman-like theorems. More specifically, we are interested in characterizing languages of words that are well-quasi-ordered under these orderings. We show that a simple characterization is possible for the prefix and suffix orderings, and that under extra regularity assumptions, this also extends to the infix ordering. We furthermore provide decision procedures for a large class of languages, that contains regular and context-free languages.

We show that they match exactly the first-order sentences preserved under local elementary embeddings, thus providing a new general preservation theorem and extending the Łós-Tarski Theorem. This full preservation result fails as usual in the finite, and we show furthermore that the naturally related decision problems are undecidable. In the more restricted case of preservation under extensions, it nevertheless yields new well-behaved classes of finite structures: we show that preservation under extensions holds if and only if it holds locally.},
